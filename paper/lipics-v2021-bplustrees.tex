\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This will be the introduction. There will be more text.

\section{\btrees\ and Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

B-trees were first proposed by Bayer in \cite{DBLP:journals/acta/BayerM72},
as a data-structure to efficiently retrieve and manipulate
indexed data stored on storage devices with slow memory access.
They are $n$-ary balanced search trees.
They may be specified as implementing a set interface,
where the indices form the actual content of the set,
the specification that serves as basis in this work.

A commonly implemented variation is the \btree, where the inner nodes
only contain separators to guide the recursive navigation through the tree.
In \btrees, all data is stored in the leaves \cite{DBLP:journals/csur/Comer79}.
Further the leaves are often implemented so as to contain pointers
to the next leaf in order, allowing for efficient range queries.

Nodes are generally thought to be implemented by
containing a number of indices, data corresponding to each index
and a number of children.

    height $2$ containing $3$ nodes and $6$ elements.

    by empty circles.}

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:data_structure_defs}

Every node contains a list of \textit{keys} (also \textit{separators}, \textit{index elements}), and \textit{subtrees} (\textit{children}),
that represent further B-tree nodes.
The separators and subtrees may be considered interleaved within a node,
such that we can speak of a subtree to the left of a separator and
a subtree to the right of a separator,
where for a separator at index $i$ we mean the subtree in the respective
subtree list at index $i$ and $i+1$ respectively.
Note that this already implies that the list of subtrees is one
longer than the list of separators - we refer to the last subtree
as the \textit{last} or \textit{dangling} subtree.
In the original definition by Bayer \cite{DBLP:journals/acta/BayerM72},
a B-tree with above structure must fulfill the three properties
\textit{balancedness}, \textit{order} and \textit{sortedness}.

\paragraph{Balancedness} \textit{Balancedness} requires
that each path from the root to any leaf has the same length $h$.
In other words, the height of all trees in one level of the tree must be equal,
where the height is the maximum path length to any leaf.
It is only possible to maintain this property
due to the flexible amount of subtrees in each node.

\paragraph{Sortedness} Further the indices must be \textit{sorted} within the tree which means that all indices stored
in the subtree to the left of a separator are smaller than the value of the separator
and all indices in the subtree to the right are greater.
Further all indices within a node should maintain a sorted order,
that is the list of separators in a node must be sorted.

\paragraph{Order} In general terms, the property of \textit{order} ensures a certain minimum and maximum
number of subtrees for each node.
However, as pointed out by Folk and Zoellick \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0095349_mod},
the property is defined differently in the literature.
For the purpose of this work, the original definition by Bayer
was chosen as most suitable.
A B-tree is of order $k$, if each internal node has at least $k+1$
subtrees and at most $2k+1$.
The root is allowed to have a minimum of 2 subtreess and a maximum of $2k+1$.

An alternative definition proposed by Knuth \cite{DBLP:books/lib/Knuth98a},
is to allow between $\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil$ and $k$ children.
However this involves cumbersome \textit{real} arithmetic that unnecessarily complicates
mechanized proofs.
Sticking to the original definition is further supported by the fact that nodes are supposed
to fill memory pages which are usually of even size (usually some power of 2).
An even number of separators and trees plus one dangling last tree maximizes
the usage of such a page.

The same ambiguity exists for the term \textit{Leaf} which we will define consistently with Knuth's definition \cite{DBLP:books/lib/Knuth98a}
to be an empty node, carrying no information,
rather than a node that contains data but no children.
This is close to the usual approach in functional programming,
and will yield more elegant recursive equations for our B-tree operations.
The lowest level of nodes hence contains a list of separators and
list of pointers to leaves as can be seen in \Cref{fig:btree-basic-nopair}.

Note that the B-tree definition is only meaningful for positive $k$.
For the case that $k$ is equal to 0,
all elements of the tree would have exactly one subtree
and no internal elements.
For the root node this even leads to a contradictory state:
It is required to contain at least 1 element or 2 subtrees.
However as it should not have more than $2k+1 = 1$ elements,
this constraint can not be satisfied.
Requiring positive $k$ is consistent with the definitions
in the consulted literature \cite{DBLP:journals/acta/BayerM72,DBLP:journals/csur/Comer79,DBLP:books/daglib/0023376}.
